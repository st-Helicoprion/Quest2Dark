    How''d you find me !?'
  - "You must want to \nknow more about here,\nhear me now~"
  - "\" She was a fiend from yonder,     \"\n  A herald of sciences of the flesh\n 
    and the spirit"
  - "\" Mankind prayed to her, with gifts \"\n  of blood and markings on stone"
  - "\" But the weak minds of man, \"\n   invited chaos and ruin"
  - "\" The goddess' blessing distorted, \"\n   her truth defiled, nothing now\n  
    but a demon in their eyes"
  - '" An existence forever intolerable "'
  - '" And her cries fell on deaf ears "'
  - "This world is a craft of \nmind and meat, where\nthoughts are made flesh"

    the contents obey the mind"
  - 'Such is this gift for you,

    its light a reflection

    of your heart'
  - Shine on you crazy HERO !

    this time, you''ll never

    catch me ever~'

    I have now truly nowhere

    else to hide~'
