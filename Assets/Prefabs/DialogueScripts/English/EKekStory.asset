  - 'AH HERO !

    How''d you find me !?'
  - "You must want to \nknow more about here,\nhear me now~"
  - "She was a fiend from yonder,  \nA herald of sciences of the flesh \nand the
    spirit"
  - 'Mankind prayed to her, with gifts

    of blood and markings on stone'
  - 'But the weak minds of man,

    invited chaos and ruin'
  - 'The goddess'' blessing distorted,

    her truth defiled, nothing now

    but
    a demon in their eyes'
  - An existence forever intolerable
  - And her cries fell on deaf ears
  - "This world is a craft of \nmind and meat, where\nthoughts are made flesh"
  - 'And so is this present for you,

    the shape of her wishes'
  - 'Find me and I''ll

    tell you more !

    Ta-ta~'

    for ya~'

    where I left off...'
  - "She was liquid,  \nencased in a shell"
  - "A shell in the form of  \nman, such was her desire,\nto be one of them"
  - 'Alas the weak hearts of

    man, gave in to fear'
  - 'Fear begot violence,

    they lashed out, and

    imprisoned her'
  - 'Cuts and slashes, tore

    apart that mockery of

    human skin'
  - 'But they could never take

    her human heart'
  - "This world is a craft of \nfluids and vessels,  the\nshell morphs to the contents,\nand
    the contents obey the mind"
  - 'Such is this gift for you,

    its light a reflection

    of your heart'
  - Shine on you crazy HERO !
  - 'I''m gonna hide better

    this time, you''ll never

    catch me ever~'
  - 'Ah HERO, flawless job

    I have now truly nowhere

    else to hide~'
  - "Here's the final part of\nthat story I was \ntelling..."
  - "Seeking acceptance,  \nshe offered man knowledge"
  - 'They feared her

'
  - 'In her curiosity, she wore

    their form'
  - They rejected her
  - "As she came upon\na heart willing to \nunderstand her"
  - 'She was met with steel

    cages, swords, fire....

    mutilation...'
  - 'Man''s world held no

    tolerance, outliers are

    met only with persecution'
  - 'Her heart understood,

    and died... '
  - 'A castle of pure darkness

    she created, let no one

    dare approach'
  - 'Awaiting the impossible

    acceptance, the hand never

    to be extended'
  - 'The home never to

    welcome her'
  - 'This world is a craft of ruin

    and darkness, a castle

    spawning phantoms
    made

    by her darkened heart,

    to keep everything out'
  - 'But this here present,

    is a symbol of...'
  - 'Her final hope, for man''s

    light of acceptance...'
  - "Fight on HERO,\nI have nothing left to \nteach you, KEK out"
