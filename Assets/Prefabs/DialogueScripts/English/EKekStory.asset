  - 'AH HERO !

    How''d you find me !?'
  - "You must want to \nknow more about here,\nhear me now~"
  - "[She was a fiend from yonder,  \nA herald of sciences of the flesh \nand the
    spirit]"
  - '[Mankind prayed to her, with gifts

    of blood and markings on stone]'
  - '[But the weak minds of man,

    invited chaos and ruin]'
  - '[The goddess'' blessing distorted,

    her truth defiled, nothing now

    but
    a demon in their eyes]'
  - "[A goddess with the legacy\nof ruin, well that's just a \ndemon...]"
  - "[Alas,  no matter how hard \nthe demon cares for man]"
  - "[To man, she is a parallel\n line, never to intersect]"
  - '[This world is a craft of

    solitude and separation,

    a clear line divides
    you and I]'

  - 'As magical as this

    gift from the stars~'
  - 'AGAIN ! You have found me

    yet again ! That''s our HERO

    for ya~'
  - 'Then let me continue

    where I left off...'
  - "[She was liquid,  \nencased in a shell]"
  - "[A shell in the form of  \nman, such was her desire,\nto be one of them]"
  - '[Alas the weak hearts of

    man, gave in to fear]'
  - '[Fear begot violence,

    they lashed out, and

    imprisoned her]'
  - '[Cuts and slashes, tore

    apart that mockery of

    human skin]'
  - '[But they could never take

    her human heart]'
  - "[This world is a craft of \nfluids and vessels,  the\nshell morphs to the contents,\nand
    the contents obey the mind]"
  - What an abstract story, eh ?
  - 'Such splendor !

    How so abstract...'
  - 'As abstract as this

    fluid-filled gift !'
  - 'Ah HERO, flawless job

    I have now truly nowhere

    else to hide~'
  - "Here's the final part of\nthat story I was \ntelling..."
  - "[Seeking acceptance,  \nshe offered man knowledge,\nThey feared her]"
  - '[In her curiosity, she wore

    their form, They rejected her]'
  - "[As she came upon\na heart willing to \nunderstand her]"
  - '[She was met with steel

    cages, swords, fire....

    mutilation...]'
  - '[Man''s world held no

    tolerance, outliers are

    met only with persecution]'
  - '[Her heart understood,

    and died... ]'
  - '[A castle of pure darkness

    she created, let no one

    dare approach]'
  - '[Awaiting the impossible

    acceptance, the hand never

    to be extended]'
  - '[The home never to

    welcome her]'
  - '[This world is a craft of ruin

    and darkness, a castle

    spawning phantoms
    made

    by her darkened heart,

    to keep everything out]'
  - Ah how truly deep...
  - 'Such magnificence !

    Such...'
  - 'Oh #$^@% !

    Look at the time !'
  - "Take this and \nGO ! Shoo !"
