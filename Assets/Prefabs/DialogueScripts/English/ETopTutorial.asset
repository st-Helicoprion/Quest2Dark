    I see you got

    the TOP'

    away from you when

    it spins, put your hand

    through
    the ring

    to jump start it !'

    Give it a smooth, smooth

    throwing
    motion !'

    throw it, and you can

    also grip to recall it
    !'

    the guards will try to stop

    it if they
    see it'
